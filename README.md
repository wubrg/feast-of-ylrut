## Background
The Caliphate of Nayibia sits protected by the coast and dense jungles in the northern region of the continent of Urae. Little is known about the Nayibians except that its jungles are many and sacred. The most sacred of all these jungles sits up in The Peaks of Fire. The Nayibians are often considered wild peoples because of this, and the ancient elves who rule these lands do little to dissuade outsiders of this. They have held sovereignty over these lands with ruthless and sometimes bloodthirsty zealotry. The population of the Nayibian Caliphate is unknown, so closely guarded are these lands. Whole armies have disappeared in the jungles along the borders. It is said that it is not the elves you must fear but the jungles themselves.

As is often the case, secrecy and suspicion lead to rumors of vast treasure and wondrous artifacts. Surrounding nations have long known to leave Nayibia alone to themselves but they are more than happy to benefit from the uninitiated passing through seeking these relics and treasures. You are one such group, or rather, your employer is. Vati is not a subtle woman. Neither slender nor stout she’s somewhere in between. She claims to be a simple scientist but looks every bit the part of an explorer, albeit without a hint of wear on her outfit or gear. She notably has no weapons that you can identify. Her associate, Dusk, however looks like he hasn’t purchased new gear in the last two decades. He has a throng of javelins about his back and a bird sits gently on his shoulder and stares with knowing eyes back at you.

You are here because you could use the money, or you’re just bored and looking for some fun, or perhaps you know Vati and owe her a favor. It doesn’t matter, because you’re here and you don’t know how to get back without her. She’s the only one who knows how to use the portal that got you here.

## Locations
### Base Camp
This is where the adventure begins. Vati and Dusk have set up an encampment with supplies and Vati’s research.

### Jungle
The dense jungle of the Nayibian Highlands. Danger lurks. The jungle can afflict the party with disease, exhaustion, and other maladies if they are not prepared. Hidden pathways can be found if the party is vigilant.

### Outpost - Monument
An outpost that Dusk has set up around an old and worn monument. It is close to Base Camp. The monument has writings in an ancient language on it that neither Dusk or Vati understand. There are hieroglyphics to go with the ancient text, but are incomplete. There is a missing section in the monument that upon inspection is not simply wear and tear. The relic fits here and activates the portal to the Ancient Dungeon Pathways.

### Jungle - Relic
Deep into the jungle the party comes across a relic that bears a striking resemblance to a glyph at the monument at Dusk’s outpost.

### Jungle - Ruins
Deep into the jungle the party comes across some covered and abandoned ruins. Amidst the ruins there are matching hieroglyphics and text to those near the monument. The ruins are waylaid with traps. There is a secret trap door that leads into the Ancient Dungeon Pathways. There is a pathway that leads to the cliffs.

### Cliffs
These cliffs overlook the Lake of Fire. There is a hidden pathway down the side of the cliffs. The only access to the cliffs is from the jungle ruins and requires the party survive an encounter with the Deathblossom Tree.

### Ancient Dungeon Pathways
These ancient pathways are dark, damp, and very hot. The party must survive numerous traps on this guarded path that leads to the Ancient Temple.

The pathways can be found amidst the ruins via a secret trap door or when the party triggers the ancient mechanisms at the monument.   

### Ancient Temple
A decorated temple overlooking a lake high up in the jungle. The temple guardians will be amicable if the party is willing to prove their worth or offer up a sacrifice to their god. Attacking these people would be futile.

### The Lake of Fire
Final Boss Fight - In the middle of the Lake of Fire sits an island where a young Red Dragon slumbers. Surviving or slaying this creature will prove the party’s worth. The guardians will offer to take the party into the Maw of Ylrut.

### Maw of Fire / Maw of Ylrut
An intense portal into the lair of the Ancient Dragon God, Ylrut.

## Encounters
### Sizzle Pig
The party has tracked the researcher's path and has come upon a wide clearing in the jungle.  Tall and short grass are intermixed in the volcanic soil. A small stream stands before them blocking their path. There are many small pools of water along the banks. The pools are bubbling, creating a steamy atmosphere.
The water is extremely hot, this is not a hot spring
Standing in the water requires a DC 13 Con save
2 failures in a row is one level of exhaustion
Success removes exhaustion
A pack of boars are drinking from the stream and parading around. They have bright ivory tusks that are stained with the dark ashen dirt and their dark fur seems to glow a faint red with their breathing. The path leads straight through them. The jungle beyond is dark and brooding.

### Boss of Toss
In the deep dense jungle the party has stumbled onto a Red Ape. Its truly terrifying and it cannot be avoided without utmost stealth.
The Red Ape heart is the needed offering to complete the Monument / Relic puzzle.
