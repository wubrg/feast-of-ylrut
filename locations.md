# Locations
## Base Camp
This is where the adventure begins. Vati and Dusk have set up an encampment with supplies and Vati’s research.

## Jungle
The dense jungle of the Nayibian Highlands. Danger lurks. The jungle can afflict the party with disease, exhaustion, and other maladies if they are not prepared. Hidden pathways can be found if the party is vigilant.

## Outpost - Monument
An outpost that Dusk has set up around an old and worn monument. It is close to Base Camp. The monument has writings in an ancient language on it that neither Dusk or Vati understand. There are hieroglyphics to go with the ancient text, but are incomplete. There is a missing section in the monument that upon inspection is not simply wear and tear. The relic fits here and activates the portal to the Ancient Dungeon Pathways.

## Jungle - Relic
Deep into the jungle the party comes across a relic that bears a striking resemblance to a glyph at the monument at Dusk’s outpost.

## Jungle - Ruins
Deep into the jungle the party comes across some covered and abandoned ruins. Amidst the ruins there are matching hieroglyphics and text to those near the monument. The ruins are waylaid with traps. There is a secret trap door that leads into the Ancient Dungeon Pathways. There is a pathway that leads to the cliffs.

## Cliffs
These cliffs overlook the Lake of Fire. There is a hidden pathway down the side of the cliffs. The only access to the cliffs is from the jungle ruins and requires the party survive an encounter with the Deathblossom Tree.

## Ancient Dungeon Pathways
These ancient pathways are dark, damp, and very hot. The party must survive numerous traps on this guarded path that leads to the Ancient Temple.

The pathways can be found amidst the ruins via a secret trap door or when the party triggers the ancient mechanisms at the monument.   

## Ancient Temple
A decorated temple overlooking a lake high up in the jungle. The temple guardians will be amicable if the party is willing to prove their worth or offer up a sacrifice to their god. Attacking these people would be futile.

## The Lake of Fire
Final Boss Fight - In the middle of the Lake of Fire sits an island where a young Red Dragon slumbers. Surviving or slaying this creature will prove the party’s worth. The guardians will offer to take the party into the Maw of Ylrut.

## Maw of Fire / Maw of Ylrut
An intense portal into the lair of the Ancient Dragon God, Ylrut.
