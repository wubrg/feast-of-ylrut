# Locations

## Jungle (Monument / Relic / Ruins)
The dense jungle of the Nayibian Highlands. Danger lurks. The jungle can afflict the party with disease, exhaustion, and other maladies if they are not prepared. Hidden pathways can be found if the party is extremely vigilant.

### Description

The Nayibian jungle is dense. Towering trees fill the mountainside. Little light reaches the floor where tree roots and large ferns dominate. Vines are abundant, hanging from the vast treetop network and wrapping around the shrubs on the floor. Flowering shrubs and fungi are plenty here. While the jungle floor is not overgrown it is thick and discombobulating. Visibility is low as a dense fog obscures your vision ahead. Sound seems to come from everywhere at once, bouncing off the enormous trees and dying on the dense foliage.

### Travel

While the party traverses the jungle they may hear a screeching / cawing in the distance. Roll a group Stealth Check to avoid being tracked by the Nightmaw.

The party can also make a Luck Roll. On a success have a party member describe how they managed to foil a "trap". On a failure, have a party member describe how they failed that same trap. A Critical failure means they share the failure with another party member, whichever is nearest them.

The party may attempt to try and "climb" up the slopes, find a path, or follow the mountainside down.

### Base Camp (Jungle)
This is where the adventure begins. Vati and Dusk have set up an encampment with supplies and Vati’s research.

### Jungle - Monument (Jungle)
In a small clearing  The monument has writings in an ancient language on it that neither Dusk or Vati understand. There are hieroglyphics to go with the ancient text, but are incomplete. There is a missing section in the monument that upon inspection is not simply wear and tear. The relic fits here and activates the portal to the Ancient Dungeon Pathways.

### Jungle - Relic (Jungle)
Deep into the jungle the party comes across a relic that bears a striking resemblance to a glyph at the monument at Dusk’s outpost.

### Jungle - Ruins (Jungle / Cliffs)
Deep into the jungle the party comes across some covered and abandoned ruins. Amidst the ruins there are matching hieroglyphics and text to those near the monument. The ruins are waylaid with traps. There is a secret trap door that leads into the Ancient Dungeon Pathways. There is a pathway that leads to the cliffs.

### Bera's Hut (Highland Jungle / Waterfall)

Nestled in an alcove at the base of the falls the party stumbles upon the home of Bera Bess. Here they may take a long rest as she offers her sage wisdom and sassy attitude.

## Cliffs

These cliffs overlook the Lake of Fire in the distance.

There is a hidden pathway down the side of the cliffs
- DC 18 Investigation / Survival to discover
- DC 16 Acrobatics / Athletics Group Skill Check to climb down

### Waterfall (Cliffs / Bera)


### Highland Jungle (Red Kong)

### Red Kong's Lair

Amidst the dense jungle, the party finds old ruins littered with bones and ash. Towering trees dot the grove and near a giant pile of bones stalks a giant ape. Roll initiative.

### Ancient Dungeon Pathways
These ancient pathways are dark, damp, and very hot. The party must survive numerous traps on this guarded path that leads to the Ancient Temple.

The pathways can be found amidst the ruins via a secret trap door or when the party triggers the ancient mechanisms at the monument.   

### Ancient Temple
This temple overlooks a lake high up in the mountains. The Temple is full of vegetation, but not overgrown. The Temple appears to be a fortified village of the Nayibians. Attacking these people would be futile. The Nayibians will not be overtly hostile to the party. The party must choose to take a chance and prove their worth or to make a sacrifice to Ylrut.

### The Lake of Fire
Final Boss Fight - In the middle of the Lake of Fire sits an island covered in swirling fog and incredible heat. The shaman who takes them to the island walks away into the fog. A young red dragon arcs above the party and lands behind them. Surviving or slaying this creature will prove the party’s worth.

### Maw of Fire / Maw of Ylrut
An intense portal into the lair of the Ancient Red Dragon God, Ylrut. Ylrut will pass judgement on the party.

If they chose subterfuge the god will be displeased. Their memory of this place will be erased and they will return to their lives with a curse.

If they defeat the young Red Dragon the god will be most impressed. They will be offered the choice to be transformed into a red dragon or gain unnaturally long life as important faction agents for Ylrut outside the Nayibian borders. They will be remembered in the annals of history.
