# Background
The Caliphate of Nayibia sits protected by the coast and dense jungles in the northern region of the continent of Alerra. Little is known about the Nayibians except that its jungles are many and sacred. The most sacred of all these jungles sits up in The Peaks of Fire. The Nayibians are often considered wild peoples because of this, and the ancient elves who rule these lands do little to dissuade outsiders of this. They have held sovereignty over these lands with ruthless and sometimes bloodthirsty zealotry. The population of the Nayibian Caliphate is unknown, so closely guarded are these lands. Whole armies have disappeared in the jungles along the borders. It is said that it is not the elves you must fear but the jungles themselves.

As is often the case, secrecy and suspicion lead to rumors of vast treasure and wondrous artifacts. Surrounding nations have long known to leave Nayibia alone to themselves. They are however more than happy to benefit from the uninitiated passing through to seek these relics and treasures. You are one such group, or rather, your employer is. Vati is not a subtle woman. Neither slender nor stout she’s somewhere in between. She claims to be a simple scientist but looks every bit the part of an explorer, albeit without a hint of wear on her outfit or gear. She notably has no weapons that you can identify. Her associate, Dusk, however looks like he hasn’t purchased new gear in the last two decades. He has a throng of javelins about his back and a bird sits gently on his shoulder and stares with knowing eyes back at you.

You are here because you could use the money, or you’re just bored and looking for some fun, or perhaps you know Vati and owe her a favor. It doesn’t matter, because you’re here and you don’t know how to get back without her. She’s the only one who knows how to use the portal stone that got you here afterall.

## Scenes
### Welcome to the Jungle
- Intro the party to Vati, Dusk and Sak
  - Base Camp, the jungle beyond, shrouded in dense foliage and a haze of fog.
- Vati’s Research
- Dusk’s findings / maps

#### Exposition
- The following should be read aloud or summarized to the players describing the base camp.

It's a bright and cheery morning when you wake up. It's a little stuffy perhaps, but nothing to complain about. Vati's made this encampment quite comfortable. You're not really sure what all the fuss was about when Dusk told you on what to expect out here.

Outside your tent, there are the tents for the other members of Vati's _guard_. Each one looks the same as yours, that is to say they are all small, but somehow quite large and comfortable on the inside. This must be an important mission for Vati to have multiple of these magic tents. But that's why you took the job, she's paying you well, _extremely_ well.

The rest of the encampment is Vati's tent, and Dusk's... well its not a tent so much as its a crude treehouse. There's an actual building structure within what appear to be some old ruins. The cloth roof strung up with rope is a stark contrast to the luxuriousness of your tent. Within this makeshift building are crates and tables full of Vati's research and Dusk's collection. You've been paid to not ask questions but damn if the secrecy doesn't make you curious. In the middle of the encampment is the portal stone, resting atop a tree stump with a big red 'Property of Vati - DO NOT TOUCH' sign glimmering in the daylight.

The encampment is walled off and the gate is closed. As you walk over to greet her and Dusk, you can overhear them arguing about the fortifications and how hidden they are. Dusk is none too happy, but Vati assures him that everything is taken care of. She assures him that the Cerberus Corps are extremely interested in this mission succeeding and have spared no expense to see it through. You hear Dusk mutter something about magic this and that, but that's the end of the conversation.

Vati looks up as you all walk over. Ahh yes, good morning! Glad to see you're all up and about, breakfast is on the way, why don't we have a seat and go over our plans for today?

#### DM Info
We start this adventure discussing the plans for the day over breakfast. Vati should ask about each of the hired guards and get them to introduce the characters to each other. Vati and Dusk can then answer questions about what we're doing here.

The plan for the day is to take the team out to a location that Dusk has marked on a map of his. The map should lead them to a stone monument that they believe will contain clues about where the Nayibian temple is located. Vati wants to find the Temple so that she can interrogate the people there and collect some information.

You can find more info on Vati and Dusk's motives in their sections on the NPC page.

##### Considerations

If the party is capable of flight, they can easily do so. However the jungle is heavily obscured with fog and the druids have encased the land in Hallucinatory Terrain. The party will get disadvantage on perception checks to find the temple due to the fog. If the party critically succeeds a DC 25 perception check they can spot the cliffs and land there. In all other cases they will be able to return to where they took off from. A critical failure will land them all the way back at the landing site.  

##### What we're doing here

### Moving through the jungle paths


### Jungle Monument
After reviewing the monument the party heads onward into the jungle. They come upon the clearing for the Sizzle Pig encounter.

They may choose to sneak around the boars but they will need to find the hidden path. The path leads directly to the relic location.

THIS NEEDS TO MATCH THE MAP!!!!

### Jungle Relic
After finding the relic the party heads back into the jungle. They come across a giant Red Kong and can fight or sneak and uncover the hidden path. The path leads directly to the monument location. They could also just turn around and go back to base camp.

### The Cliffs
After surviving the onslaught of angry chickens the party comes to a cliff-face that overlook the Lake of Fire. It is possible the party finds a path directly to the lake but it is treacherous. There are other dead bodies strewn about here that contain journals, special items that hint at what they can expect at the lake.

### The Temple

- Intro the guardians and their demands
  - Test your might
  - sacrifice
  - attack!
