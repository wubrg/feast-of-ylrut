# Background
The Caliphate of Nayibia sits protected by the coast and dense jungles in the northern region of the continent of Urae. Little is known about the Nayibians except that its jungles are many and sacred. The most sacred of all these jungles sits up in The Peaks of Fire. The Nayibians are often considered wild peoples because of this, and the ancient elves who rule these lands do little to dissuade outsiders of this. They have held sovereignty over these lands with ruthless and sometimes bloodthirsty zealotry. The population of the Nayibian Caliphate is unknown, so closely guarded are these lands. Whole armies have disappeared in the jungles along the borders. It is said that it is not the elves you must fear but the jungles themselves.

As is often the case, secrecy and suspicion lead to rumors of vast treasure and wondrous artifacts. Surrounding nations have long known to leave Nayibia alone to themselves but they are more than happy to benefit from the uninitiated passing through seeking these relics and treasures. You are one such group, or rather, your employer is. Vati is not a subtle woman. Neither slender nor stout she’s somewhere in between. She claims to be a simple scientist but looks every bit the part of an explorer, albeit without a hint of wear on her outfit or gear. She notably has no weapons that you can identify. Her associate, Dusk, however looks like he hasn’t purchased new gear in the last two decades. He has a throng of javelins about his back and a bird sits gently on his shoulder and stares with knowing eyes back at you.

You are here because you could use the money, or you’re just bored and looking for some fun, or perhaps you know Vati and owe her a favor. It doesn’t matter, because you’re here and you don’t know how to get back without her. She’s the only one who knows how to use the portal that got you here.
