# Background
The Caliphate of Nayibia sits protected by the coast and dense jungles in the northern region of the continent of Alerra. Little is known about the Nayibians except that its jungles are many and sacred. The most sacred of all these jungles sits up in The Peaks of Fire. The Nayibians are often considered wild peoples because of this, and the ancient elves who rule these lands do little to dissuade outsiders of this. They have held sovereignty over these lands with ruthless and sometimes bloodthirsty zealotry. The population of the Nayibian Caliphate is unknown, so closely guarded are these lands. Whole armies have disappeared in the jungles along the borders. It is said that it is not the elves you must fear but the jungles themselves.

As is often the case, secrecy and suspicion lead to rumors of vast treasure and wondrous artifacts. Surrounding nations have long known to leave Nayibia alone to themselves. They are however more than happy to benefit from the uninitiated passing through to seek these relics and treasures. You are one such group, or rather, your employer is. Vati is not a subtle woman. Neither slender nor stout she’s somewhere in between. She claims to be a simple scientist but looks every bit the part of an explorer, albeit without a hint of wear on her outfit or gear. She notably has no weapons that you can identify. Her associate, Dusk, however looks like he hasn’t purchased new gear in the last two decades. He has a throng of javelins about his back and a bird sits gently on his shoulder and stares with knowing eyes back at you.

You are here because you could use the money, or you’re just bored and looking for some fun, or perhaps you know Vati and owe her a favor. It doesn’t matter, because you’re here and you don’t know how to get back without her. She’s the only one who knows how to use the portal stone that got you here afterall.

## Scenes
### Welcome to the Jungle
It's a bright and cheery morning when you wake up. After breakfast in the mess hall the party converges in the appointed meeting room here in the Cerberus Corporation HQ. Dusk enters the room and introduces himself and his avian companion, Sak. He makes sure everyone is ready to go and is prepared to assist him and Vati in the Nayibian jungles. He gives everyone 2 potions of healing and tells Sak to "do the thing for them too". Sak squawks and flaps his wings and everyone feels a sense of safety and assuredness. Have each player roll a d4 from Sak's table.

He isn't particularly forthcoming about _what_ is so important. He mentions that they'll need to investigate the Reliquary Tree again and that they haven't had enough muscle to make it back.

When the party is ready, he leads them through a portal and they arrive in the sending circle at base camp.

##### Beaks of Terror

Base camp is a horror scene. Death and destruction are everywhere. Tents are burning and smoke is thick. Blood stains the dirt in the main thoroughfare of the camp.

- Set the scene, build tension
- Dusk -> Find Vati! The portal is a one-way gate, without her they're stuck here.
- Party fans out, a Deathbeak corpse lays twitching near one tent. So many bodies near it though.
- Another Deathbeak appears (think Jurassic Park)
- Vati runs, begin chase scene (tidbit - Dusk yells at Vati "I told you we should've setup closer to water!")

_Roll initiative_

If someone dies here, they can "find" their backup character hiding in a tent nearby.

##### Considerations

If the party is capable of flight, they can easily do so. However the jungle is heavily obscured with fog and the druids have encased the land in Hallucinatory Terrain. The party will get disadvantage on perception checks trying to view the jungle from above. They may see basic landmarks like a river (waterfall), a particularly large tree (Red Kong), a clearing in the forest (ruins), etc.
