## Friends

### Vati

Vati is a sturdy woman dressed in a pristine jungle explorer outfit. She possesses a firearm with the vorpal ability. She is a scientist with the Cerberus Corporation (CC) and she is researching the peculiar magical events happening in the Peaks of Fire. The CC is an organization focused on advancing science through the study of the arcane.

Vati is the only NPC who knows how to activate the portal stone to take the party back home. Amongst other trinkets, she has a sending stone that she shares with Dusk, some notes about various aspects of the jungle that she and Dusk have discovered so far, and some notes about the Nayibians and various local legends (Bera, Red Kong, El Squawkacapbra).

The Cerberus Corps are searching for an artifact called the Worldheart. The Worldheart Shard is a tooth of the Ancient Red Dragon God Ylrut. Ylrut used it to create his lair deep in the heart of the Peaks of Fire. It is the source of the lush jungle environment at 20k feet.

## Foes
The Nayibians guard a terrible secret. The awakening of the Ancient Red Dragon God Ylrut will be a calamity unto all that live on Alerra and beyond.

If the party attempts diplomacy when interacting with the Nayibians they can be enticed to let the party solve some problems for them. The Nayibian shamans and chieftains will lead the party to the location of the Death Tree or the Red Kong as proof of their right to continue living in the jungle. They will fully expect the party to fail these encounters, and their success would be proof that they are just what they need to keep Ylrut sated and lead the party to the temple for their "final test".
