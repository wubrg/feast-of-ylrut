# Encounters
## Sizzle Pig
The party has tracked the researcher's path and has come upon a wide clearing in the jungle.  Tall and short grass are intermixed in the volcanic soil. A small stream stands before them blocking their path. There are many small pools of water along the banks. The pools are bubbling, creating a steamy atmosphere.
The water is extremely hot, this is not a hot spring
Standing in the water requires a DC 13 Con save
2 failures in a row is one level of exhaustion
Success removes exhaustion
A pack of boars are drinking from the stream and parading around. They have bright ivory tusks that are stained with the dark ashen dirt and their dark fur seems to glow a faint red with their breathing. The path leads straight through them. The jungle beyond is dark and brooding.

## Boss of Toss
In the deep dense jungle the party has stumbled onto a Red Ape. It is truly terrifying and it cannot be avoided without utmost stealth.
The Red Ape heart is the needed offering to complete the Monument / Relic puzzle.

Another ancient monument sits here with hints at how the party might find the temple
Researching the monument leads the party too close to the strange tree that triggers the call of a nearby deathbeak
